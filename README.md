# Monastery Gazetteer

For this project, I again turned to my academic research in Tibetan Buddhism for inspiration. This is an app to allows you to explore monasteries and Tibetan Buddhist figures, and the relationships between them. A monastery can have many figures, obviously, but a Buddhist figure can also have many monasteriesâ€“their home monastery, but those they inhabited briefly to obtain an education, those they founded, and others they may have been connected to. This app would allow researchers to see that famous figures were influenced by a wide range of traditions through their connections to different monasteries. The many-to many relationship between monasteries and figures can be easily modelled in Rails with an SQL database, while JavaScript provides a frontend for a simple, one page interface in which users can explore monasteries, figures, and the relationships between then, and add new monasteries and figures, and their associations, to the database.
